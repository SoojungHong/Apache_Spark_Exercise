====================================
1. Correct Spark and Scala version
====================================
It is important to set correct version of Scala and Spark. Otherwise, code will not be compile. The version should be precisely correct. 
(Example of build.sbt)
name := "ParquetExercise"
version := "1.0"
scalaVersion := "2.10.5"
libraryDependencies += "org.apache.spark" %% "spark-core" % "1.6.1"
libraryDependencies += "org.apache.spark" %% "spark-sql" % "1.6.1"
